Nuit de l'info 2020, page de prévision météorologique des spots de surf Français.

"Nuit de l'info 2020", weather forecast for French surf spots.

Built with EJS and express.

## Available commands
```sh
npm run start
npm run dev
```

## Additional informations
"Nuit de l'info" means "Night of computer science", it's a group challenge for French students. There is a given 
subject with requirements and you have one night to build a project. Our group was composed of 9 students, and a lot of them were in their 
first year of CS. It was a nice challenge to deal with the level gap between people to give everyone something to do. This repo is only a part of
the website I worked on, the full website is not available anymore.

## What have I done
- Helped defining goals and project scope.
- Assigned tasks and helped other students.
- Server setup with another student (A Debian machine hosted by ovh).
- Gathered the list of spots in France and made an API to fetch forecast data.
- Built a page to show france spot list and forecast data to users.
- Worked all night long.

## Retrospective
It was a very good experience so far, the team was very cool and welcoming, we had a lot of fun.
We successfully ran our project to billions of users (no).
I just think it's a shame that it take place at night, messing up students sleep schedule, some had to stop early because they were tired
or because they had class the next day, some stayed all night long since their class was canceled for them due to this event.
Moving the event the day and being exempt from class would avoid messing up students sleep schedule and keep all positive aspects of this event.
Anyway, very good experience overall, good team, nice project, had fun!
